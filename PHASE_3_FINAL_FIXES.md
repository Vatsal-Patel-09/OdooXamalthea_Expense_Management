# 🔧 Phase 3 Final Fixes & Missing Pages

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Decimal Precision Problem (677 → 676.98)

**Problem:** Floating-point precision issues when storing amounts
- User enters: `677`
- Database stores: `676.98`

**Root Cause:** Python's `float()` has precision issues with decimal numbers

**Solution:** Use Python's `Decimal` class for precise decimal arithmetic

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routes/expenses.py`

**Changes:**
```python
# Before (❌ Precision issues)
'amount': float(data['amount'])

# After (✅ Exact precision)
from decimal import Decimal, ROUND_HALF_UP
'amount': str(Decimal(str(data['amount'])).quantize(Decimal('0.01'), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP))
```

**Applied to:**
- ✅ Create expense endpoint
- ✅ Update expense endpoint

**Testing:**
- Enter `677` → Stores exactly `677.00`
- Enter `100.5` → Stores exactly `100.50`
- Enter `99.999` → Rounds to `100.00`

### ✅ Issue 2: Missing Pages for Edit & View Expense

**Problem:** No UI to edit or view expense details

**Solution:** Created two new pages

#### Page 1: Edit Expense
**File:** `frontend/src/app/expenses/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Load existing expense data
- ✅ Pre-populate all fields
- ✅ Validate expense is "draft" status (only drafts can be edited)
- ✅ All fields editable: category, amount, currency, date, paid by, description
- ✅ Change receipt (upload new file)
- ✅ View current receipt
- ✅ Save changes
- ✅ Cancel button
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation

**URL:** `/expenses/:id/edit`
**Example:** http://localhost:3000/expenses/abc-123-def/edit

**Access:**
- Users can edit their own draft expenses
- Admins can edit any draft expense

#### Page 2: View Expense Details
**File:** `frontend/src/app/expenses/[id]/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- ✅ Full expense details display
- ✅ Large amount display
- ✅ Status badge (color-coded)
- ✅ Category name
- ✅ Formatted dates
- ✅ Receipt view button (opens in new tab)
- ✅ Submitted by information
- ✅ Action buttons based on status:
  - **Draft:** Edit, Submit for Approval
  - **Other statuses:** Back to List
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation

**URL:** `/expenses/:id`
**Example:** http://localhost:3000/expenses/abc-123-def

**Layout:**
```
