## 🔍 Pre-Submission Verification

### Critical Path Testing

#### Test 1: Environment Setup ⏳
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# Expected: Server starts on port 5000

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Expected: Server starts on port 3000
```
- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] Frontend starts without errors
- [ ] No dependency errors

#### Test 2: Database Connection ⏳
- [ ] Supabase connection works
- [ ] All tables exist
- [ ] Migrations applied
- [ ] Default users exist (admin, manager, employee)

#### Test 3: Approval Workflow (CRITICAL) ⏳
**This is the most important test!**

1. [ ] Login as admin → Create approval rule
2. [ ] Login as employee → Create expense → Submit for approval
3. [ ] Verify status = "Pending Approval" (NOT "Approved")
4. [ ] Login as manager → View pending approvals
5. [ ] Approve the expense
6. [ ] Login as employee → Verify status = "Approved"

**If this test fails, the project is not ready for submission!**

#### Test 4: Core Features ⏳
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] User management (admin only)
- [ ] Category management
- [ ] Expense CRUD operations
- [ ] File upload works
- [ ] Currency selection works
- [ ] Statistics display correctly

   - **Documented**: QUICKSTART.md, README.md

2. **Email Notifications**: Not implemented
   - Out of scope for hackathon
   - Can be added later

3. **Audit Trail**: Basic (created_at, updated_at)
   - Full audit log not implemented
   - Sufficient for MVP

4. **Advanced Search**: Basic filters only
   - Full-text search not implemented
   - Current filters cover main use cases
