# 🎉 PHASE 2: CATEGORY MANAGEMENT - COMPLETE!

**Date:** October 4, 2025

---

## ✅ What Was Built

### **Backend API - Complete** ✅

Created `backend/routes/categories.py` with full CRUD operations:

1. **GET /api/categories** - List all categories
   - Filter by `is_active` status
   - Company-scoped (only see your company's categories)
   - Ordered by name
   
2. **GET /api/categories/:id** - Get single category details

3. **POST /api/categories** (Admin Only) - Create new category
   - Validates category name (alphanumeric, spaces, hyphens)
   - Prevents duplicates per company
   - Required: `name`
   - Optional: `description`

4. **PUT /api/categories/:id** (Admin Only) - Update category
   - Update name, description, or active status
   - Prevents duplicate names
   - Validates all inputs

5. **DELETE /api/categories/:id** (Admin Only) - Delete/deactivate category
   - Smart delete: If category has expenses → soft delete (set is_active=false)
   - If no expenses → hard delete (remove from database)

**Registered in:** `backend/app.py` at `/api/categories`

---

### **Frontend UI - Complete** ✅

Created `frontend/src/app/admin/categories/page.tsx`:

**Features:**
- ✅ Beautiful card-based category list
- ✅ Create new category dialog
- ✅ Edit category dialog  
- ✅ Delete category with confirmation
- ✅ Shows inactive categories with visual indicator
- ✅ Admin-only access (redirects non-admins)
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error handling with toast notifications
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- ✅ Back to dashboard link

## 🚀 How to Test

### **Backend API Test:**

1. Open `backend/test_categories.html` (will create next)
2. Login first to get token
3. Test all CRUD operations:
   - Create category "Travel"
   - List all categories
   - Update category
   - Delete category

### **Frontend UI Test:**

1. **Run frontend:** `cd frontend && pnpm dev`
2. **Login as admin:** http://localhost:3000/login
3. **Go to categories:** http://localhost:3000/admin/categories
4. **Test operations:**
   - Click "New Category" → Create "Travel" category
   - Click edit icon → Update category name
   - Click delete icon → Delete category
   - Verify inactive categories show as grayed out

## 🎯 What's Next: Phase 3 - Expense Management

With categories in place, we can now build the expense system:

### **Backend APIs to Build:**
1. **File Upload API** (for receipts)
   - POST /api/upload
   - Integrates with Supabase Storage
   - Returns receipt URL

2. **Expense CRUD API**
   - POST /api/expenses (create draft)
   - GET /api/expenses (list with filters)
   - GET /api/expenses/:id (get details)
   - PUT /api/expenses/:id (update draft only)
   - DELETE /api/expenses/:id
   - POST /api/expenses/:id/submit (submit for approval)

### **Frontend Pages to Build:**
1. **Expense Creation Form**
   - Category dropdown (from categories API) ✅
   - Currency dropdown (from currencies API) ✅
   - Paid by dropdown (personal/company) ✅
   - Receipt upload
   - Amount, date, description
   - Save as draft or submit

2. **Expense List View**
   - Table/card view of expenses
   - Filter by status, category, date
   - Multi-currency display
   - Edit draft expenses
   - Submit expenses for approval
