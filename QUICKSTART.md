# 🎯 Final Verification & Quick Start Guide

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Approval Workflow Verification

### Issue: Auto-Approval Behavior
If expenses are being auto-approved, it means **no approval rules exist** in the database.

### Solution: Create Approval Rules

1. **Login as Admin**
   - Email: `admin@expense.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

2. **Navigate to Approval Rules**
   - Click "Approval Rules" in the navigation menu

3. **Create a Rule** (Example)
   ```
   Name: Manager Approval
   Description: All expenses require manager approval
   Min Amount: 0
   Max Amount: 100000
   Currency: USD
   Priority: 1
   Is Sequential: No (unchecked)
   Approval Percentage: 100
   Approvers: Select "Manager" from dropdown
   ```

4. **Click Create**

5. **Verify Rule Created**
   - Rule should appear in the list
   - Note: Without any rules, expenses will be auto-approved!

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "No approval rule found - expense auto-approved"
**Cause:** No approval rules exist in database
**Fix:** Create at least one approval rule as admin

### Issue 2: "Failed to trigger approval workflow"
**Cause:** Database schema mismatch
**Fix:** Run migrations:
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
-- Run: backend/migrations/add_approval_rule_columns.sql
-- Run: backend/migrations/fix_approval_rule_approvers.sql
```

### Issue 3: "Import flask could not be resolved"
**Cause:** Virtual environment not activated
**Fix:** 
```bash
cd backend
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
```

### Issue 4: Cannot login
**Cause:** Users don't exist in database
**Fix:** Run initial setup to create default users (check README.md)

### Issue 5: File upload fails
**Cause:** Supabase storage bucket not configured
**Fix:** 
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
2. Create bucket named `receipts`
3. Make it public
4. Allow image uploads
