## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Supabase Storage Setup Required

Before testing file upload, you need to create a storage bucket in Supabase:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Create a new bucket named `receipts`
3. Set bucket to **public** (for public URLs)
4. Update policies:
   ```sql
   -- Allow authenticated users to upload
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
   ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
   TO authenticated
   WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'receipts');
   
   -- Allow authenticated users to read their company's files
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated reads"
   ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
   TO authenticated
   USING (bucket_id = 'receipts');
   
   -- Allow authenticated users to delete their company's files
   CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes"
   ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
   TO authenticated
   USING (bucket_id = 'receipts');
   ```

### Database Migration

If you haven't run the migration yet, execute this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add paid_by column to expenses table
ALTER TABLE expenses 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS paid_by VARCHAR(20) 
CHECK (paid_by IN ('personal', 'company'));

-- Update existing expenses (set default)
UPDATE expenses 
SET paid_by = 'personal' 
WHERE paid_by IS NULL;

-- Make it required for new expenses
ALTER TABLE expenses 
ALTER COLUMN paid_by SET NOT NULL;
```
