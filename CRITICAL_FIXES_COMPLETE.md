# ✅ CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED - Summary
**Date:** October 4, 2025

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

### **Issue #1: Missing `paid_by` Field in Expenses Table** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Database schema was missing the `paid_by` field to track whether expense was paid by employee (personal) or company card.

**Solution:**
1. ✅ Created migration script: `backend/fix_expenses_paid_by.sql`
2. ✅ Updated main schema: `backend/database_schema.sql`
3. ✅ Added field with constraint: `CHECK (paid_by IN ('personal', 'company'))`

**SQL to Run in Supabase:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE expenses 
ADD COLUMN paid_by VARCHAR(20) 
CHECK (paid_by IN ('personal', 'company')) 
DEFAULT 'personal';
```

### **Issue #2: Missing Country/Currency Dropdown in Signup** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Signup form had hardcoded currency dropdown, no country selection as shown in wireframes.

**Solution:**

#### **Backend Changes:**
1. ✅ Created `backend/utils/currency.py` - Complete currency utility module
   - Fetches countries from REST Countries API
   - Gets exchange rates from ExchangeRate API
   - Currency conversion functions
   - Validation helpers

2. ✅ Created `backend/routes/countries.py` - New API endpoints:
   - `GET /api/countries` - List all countries with currencies
   - `GET /api/currencies` - List all available currencies
   - `GET /api/exchange-rates/:currency` - Get current rates
   - `POST /api/convert` - Convert between currencies

3. ✅ Registered countries blueprint in `backend/app.py`

4. ✅ Added `requests` package to `requirements.txt`

5. ✅ Installed `requests` package in virtual environment

#### **Frontend Changes:**
1. ✅ Updated `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - Added countries API methods:
   ```typescript
   countries: {
     list: () => apiClient.get('/countries'),
     currencies: () => apiClient.get('/currencies'),
     exchangeRates: (baseCurrency: string) => ...,
     convert: (data: {...}) => ...
   }
   ```

2. ✅ Updated `frontend/src/app/signup/page.tsx`:
   - Added country dropdown (fetches from API)
   - Auto-sets currency based on selected country
   - Shows primary currency for each country
   - Currency field is now read-only (auto-filled)

GET  /api/exchange-rates/USD  - Get current exchange rates for USD
POST /api/convert             - Convert amount between currencies
```

#### **Utility Functions (backend/utils/currency.py):**
- `get_countries_with_currencies()` - Fetch countries from REST API (cached)
- `get_currency_list()` - Get unique currencies
- `get_exchange_rates(base)` - Get current rates for base currency
- `convert_currency(amount, from, to)` - Convert between currencies
